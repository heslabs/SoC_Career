[https://careers.arm.com/job/manchester/staff-verification-engineer/33099/70349038096]
Specify and develop new hardware verification testbenches for future generation hardware IP.

### Responsibilities:
You will specify and develop new hardware verification testbenches for future generation hardware IP. You will improve existing testbenches to increase performance, quality and efficiency. You will also identify areas for improvement in methodologies and implement those changes to advance our best-practises for hardware verification.
* Reviewing and assessing proposed design changes from a verification complexity point of view
* Ownership of verification environment from investigation all the way to verification closure
* Investigating and scripting new verification flows and optimising existing ones
* Analysis of data from simulation runs using machine learning and data science techniques to drive efficient bug discovery and coverage closure
* There will be opportunities for improving our verification methodology collaborating with arm engineering teams
* mentoring members of the team

### Required Skills and Experience:
* Can demonstrate experience in working with constrained-random verification including ownership of complex verification environment.
* Experience of using SystemVerilog and UVM
* Proven software engineering skills including understanding of object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms.
* You are competent developing verification flows, making the best use of EDA tools and have good scripting skills and are able to plan and estimate your own work.

### 'Nice To Have' Skills and Experience:
* Team leadership and mentoring experience
* Multiprocessing microarchitecture experience including knowledge of cache coherence and bus protocols (e.g. AMBA5 CHI, AMBA4 ACE or AXI)
* Experience in Formal Verification testbenches is a plus.
* Strong communication and ability to work well as part of a team.
* Dedicated with a focused approach to problem analysis and solving.
